# QML Clipboard Manager

This program is meant to be a small project with the goal to learn more on how declarative programming using QML works. Currently, it's capable of watching the clipboard, checking if any text or image files were copied. The contents will be displayed in a list. Images will be converted to their Base64 representation. Contents can also be copied back to the clipboard.

This project was created with Qt 5.15 / Qt Quick 5.15.2 and requires CMake for building.
